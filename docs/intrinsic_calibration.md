# Intrinsic Calibration



- **intrinsic calibration**:  footage for each camera (can be non-synchronized) that has a charuco board moving across the whole FOV of the camera at various distances with the board at various angles to show foreshortening. 

- Important note: If the board is only registered in small parts of the FOV, or is only shown flat relative to the camera, there will be problems in the calibration.
