> *ChatGPT*: Sure, here's a simplified, plain language summary of the BSD-2-Clause license for your open source project. Please note, this is an informal summary and does not substitute legal advice.

> 1. **You can use the code however you like.**
>   The code is free. You can copy it, modify it, or use it in your own projects, whether they're open source or not.

> 2. **Keep the copyright notice.**
>   If you use this code, you have to make sure the original copyright notice (that is, the one you got with the code that says who created it) stays in it. This is the same whether you use all the code or just a part of it. You also need to include a copy of the license.

> 3. **No warranty.**
>  The code doesn't come with any promise that it'll work or that the creator will help you if it doesn't. If something goes wrong when you use it, you can't hold the original author or any contributors responsible.

> That's it. The BSD-2-Clause license is really about letting you do what you want, as long as you remember to credit the people who made it and don't try to sue them if something goes wrong.
