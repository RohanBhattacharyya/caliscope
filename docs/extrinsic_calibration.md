# Extrinsic Calibration
- **extrinsic calibration**: synchronized footage with a charuco board swept throughout the capture volume, ideally touching down to where you would like the origin setÂ 

- "synchronized" here means either all frames are time locked in order, or there is a file that specifies the time at which each frame was recorded which allows the synchronization down stream
- important note: the calibration will improve as the number of concurrent captures of the board from multiple cameras increases."Orphaned" cameras will bungle the optimization if they don't share common views with at least one other camera.
