# Welcome


Pyxy3D is an open-source software tool for calibrating multiple simple webcams such that they can be used for 3D point tracking, allowing users to create small-scale DIY motion capture studios. This project is at a very early stage so please bear with us while going through the inevitable growing pains that are ahead. You feedback is appreciated. If you have specific recommendations, please consider creating an [issue](https://github.com/mprib/pyxy3d/issues). If you have more general questions or thoughts about the project, please open up a thread in the [discussions](https://github.com/mprib/pyxy3d/discussions).

If you are just starting out here and trying to get a basic handle on what this is, what it does, and how it is used, it might be best to dive into the [FAQ]().

From there, the [installation]() guide will walk you through the process of getting a system up and running, the [calibration]() guide will help you get it dialed in, and the [motion capture]() guide will walk through the process of collecting data.

Please note that landmark position data is currently only being exported to `csv` and `trc` (used by biomechanists) formats, which very likeLy is not going to satisfy the needs of animators. If you have experience in character rigging and python programming and are interested in contributing, please reach out in [discussions]() to get the ball rolling on a game plan. Pull requests are welcome!
